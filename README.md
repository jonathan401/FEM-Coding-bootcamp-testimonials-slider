## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- I mostly learnt how to overlap items using CSS Flexbox
- I also learnt about using the `aria-live` attribute along with the `aria-controls` in html in order to help screen readers announed the updates when the testimonial card is updated

### Useful resources

- [The Aria live region](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/ARIA_Live_Regions) - This MDN article helped me understand better how the `aria-live` attribute works.
